# javascript-challenge

This project involves creating a dynamic UFO sighting data table with a filter functionality that allows the resulting output data to be based upon the parameters the user specify.

The code for this webpage uses only JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

Instruction for user:
The table shows all the data as a default. Fill out the `Filter` forms based on the date, city, state, country and/or shape to get the result you wish to search. Multiple filters can be applied at the same time.

To reset your result search, click on the `Reset` button or refresh the page to get the default result prior to any filters being applied.
